//! Delta Table properties. Note this module implements per-table configuration which governs how
//! table-level capabilities/properties are configured (turned on/off etc.). This is orthogonal to
//! protocol-level 'table features' which enable or disable reader/writer features (which then
//! usually must be enabled/configured by table properties).
//!
//! For example (from delta's protocol.md): A feature being supported does not imply that it is
//! active. For example, a table may have the `appendOnly` feature listed in writerFeatures, but it
//! does not have a table property delta.appendOnly that is set to `true`. In such a case the table
//! is not append-only, and writers are allowed to change, remove, and rearrange data. However,
//! writers must know that the table property delta.appendOnly should be checked before writing the
//! table.
